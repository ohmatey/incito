Good prompts get better with small, safe changes. Use this flow to improve results without losing what already works.

## 1) Make a Variant
Create a copy before you change anything. That gives you a safe rollback.

## 2) Compare Outputs
Run the same input through both versions. Keep the one that is clearer and more consistent.

## 3) Save Notes
Write one short reason for the change, like "Added output format" or "Reduced length".

## Quality Checklist
- **Clarity**: Is the instruction unambiguous?
- **Constraints**: Are length and tone clear?
- **Format**: Is the output structure explicit?

## Recommendations
- Use examples whenever possible
- Add a clear output format
- Prefer small changes per iteration
