title: Build a Prompt
---

This guide uses one example end to end: **Customer Feedback Summary**.

## Step 1: Define the Goal
Write one sentence about the outcome you want.

Example goal:
"Summarize customer feedback into 3 key themes and 5 action items."

## Step 2: Add Inputs
Identify the information you will paste in each time.

Example inputs:
- `feedback_text` (the raw feedback)
- `product_name`

## Step 3: Set the Output Format
Tell the AI exactly how the output should look.

Example format:
- 3 bullet themes
- 5 numbered action items
- Keep it under 120 words

## Step 4: Save and Name It Clearly
Use a name your team will recognize later, like "Customer Feedback Summary".

## Step 5: Run a Quick Test
Paste a short sample and verify the output looks right.

### Tip: No Syntax Required
You do not need to write special prompt syntax. Think in plain language and keep the instructions clear.
