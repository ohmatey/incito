title: Getting Started
---

This quick start assumes you want to build prompts without writing code.

## Step 1: Pick a Prompts Folder
Choose a folder where your prompts will live. Incito reads and saves prompts there.

## Step 2: Create Your First Prompt
Click **New Prompt** and choose a blank template. Give it a clear name like "Customer Feedback Summary".

## Step 3: Run It Once
Fill in the inputs, then copy or launch the prompt to your AI tool. If the output is close, save it and iterate.

## Glossary (Plain Language)
- **Prompt**: The instructions you give the AI.
- **Template**: A reusable prompt with placeholders.
- **Variable**: A placeholder you fill in each time, like `feedback_text`.

## Troubleshooting
If nothing shows up after selecting a folder, create a sample prompt in that folder and try again.
