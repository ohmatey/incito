## Do I need to know syntax?
No. Use plain language. If the tool shows variables, just fill in the fields it provides.

## Why are outputs inconsistent?
Small changes in inputs can change outputs. Add clearer instructions and an explicit output format to reduce variation.

## How do I share prompts with my team?
Save prompts with clear names and descriptions. When team sharing is available, you can export or sync them.
